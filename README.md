# Welcome to my ALX Software Engineering Program first Repo

This repository contains my coursework and projects for the ALX Software Engineering Program.

## About the Program

The ALX Software Engineering program is a hands-on, project-based learning experience that covers a wide range of topics in software engineering, including:

- Git
- Linux
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Python
- Algorithms and data structures
- Object-oriented programming

Throughout the program, I will be working on a series of projects that will help me build my skills and gain real-world experience in software engineering.

## Coursework

In this repository, you will find my coursework for the ALX Software Engineering program. Each directory corresponds to a different module or project, and contains the relevant files and documentation.

## Projects

In addition to my coursework, I will also be working on a series of projects throughout the program. These projects will allow me to apply the skills and knowledge that I have learned to real-world problems and scenarios.

Thank you for visiting my repo!!
